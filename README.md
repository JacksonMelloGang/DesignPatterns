# DesignPatterns
Explanation about design patterns in OOP


# But First, What is it ?

A design pattern is some sort of blueprint / pattern designed to solve a problem in a situation. 

It's goal is to make your code, more easy to understand for others developers, 
and therefore make the process of software design more efficient and more cost effective:

> How ? <br>
> By Providing a common vocabulary and reusable solutions 


## Differents Types of design patterns

Well first, there are many many design patterns that exists in the wild, but we can categorize all that into 5 mains categories:

## Creational patterns:
These focus on the ways in which objects are created and instantiated. Examples: Singleton, Factory, Builder.

## Structural patterns: 
These focus on the ways in which different objects in an application are connected together. Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite.

## Behavioral patterns:
These focus on the communication between objects in an application. Examples: Observer, Iterator, Mediator.

## Architectural patterns:
These are more high level and provide overall guidance for designing a software architecture. Examples: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Microservices.

## Concurrency and parallelism patterns:
These focus on the efficient execution of multiple threads or processes. Examples: Thread Pool, Producer-Consumer, Monitor Object.

> NOTE: There are also patterns that you shouldn't use or avoid to use as they can lead to poor design / performance
